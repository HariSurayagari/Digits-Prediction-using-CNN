# Digits-Prediction-using-CNN

MINIST data is a common data for computer vision. The target of this dataset is to identify the digits accurately. There are many machine learning approaches to achieve this but one of the more commonly used techniques is Deep Learning, more specifically Convoluted Neural Networks. This project was to use a CNN on MINIST data, this project achieved an accuracy of 99.35%.
